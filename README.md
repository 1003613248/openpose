## STAF Algorithm

This is a real-time live-demo of the STAF multi-person pose detection and tracker. Build instructions are similar to OpenPose as it is built of it's internal code.

`cd models; sh getModels.sh`

`build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --model_pose BODY_21A --tracking 1  --render_pose 1`
